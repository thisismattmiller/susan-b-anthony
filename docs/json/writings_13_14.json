Of her\n400,000 slaves, not less than 50,000 stalwart35\nfreed men would have rallied to our\naid. And with such an allied force\nof grateful hearts & generous hands, what\nother state would have dared to go\nto the rescue of those South Carolina\ntyrants? - Or if they went, what fate\nawaited them, but freedom to their\nslaves, and a fresh marshalling of\nthose only loyal men to our advancing\n[hosts of freedom] - army-\nNone know better than the Rebels the\nsecret of their power. Not one , or all, the\nseceded states, could, unaided & alone,\nmaintain slavery. Every day's reports\nfrom the Slaves, proves the old assertion,\nthat they have been held in their chains37\nby fear of Federal power, rather\nthan that of their masters.- They\nhave always been thoroughly educated to\nknow the solemn obligations of the North,\nto their oppressors, and how utterly\nhopeless were all attempts at insurrection\nand revolution, while the United States\narmy stands ready, at the first tap of\nthe drum, to beat them back to the plantations.\nOur sham republican government,\nhas stood sentry over the slave\nplantations of the South, from the day\nof its birth- and all other civilized\nnations have silently looked on.-\nIf, in the beginning, such stern Eman-\ncipation policy would have most speedily, forever", "similar": {"daybook":

Kelly\nStone\nCamp Holt,\nGen. M. Cook\nSteele\nQuimby43\nUnder your gradual emancipation scheme,\ndo you expect to return the thousands &\ntens of thousands of slaves now within\nour Military lines , back to their old Status?-\nWill those men & women who are\nto day working for wages,- purchasing\ntheir own food & clothing, learning to\nread their own Bible, - paying their\nown ministers to preach to them the\ngospel of freedom to the black man,-\nmarrying & giving in marriage that no slave\ntyrant may put asunder,- living serenely,\nin the blest enjoyment of all the rights\n& privileges sacred to humanity?- Will\nthey with alacrity , return to unpaid\ntoil for the brief term even of 10 or 20 years?44\nWill they cheerfully give their palm-\niest days to slavery, that their chil-\ndren may be- free? It is worse than\nfolly, it is madness, to propose it.\nInsurrections, fearful & bloody\nwould surely follow, any & every at-\ntempt to subject those heroic freed-\nmen to the old regime of the lash.\nAnd if you leave them free, think\nyou they will forget their Fathers & Mothers,\ntheir brothers & Sisters, their husbands,\nwives & children still in chains, & never\nmake one effort to rescue their loved\nones from the galling yoke: I tell\nyou never!! - Remember the weary\nyears figurative slaves, in the north, have45\nstruggled to get money to pay the\ncruel price of a slave Mother,\nor Father or daughter. the hundreds, who\nhave re-visited their old prison-\nhomes & spirited away the beloved\nof their hearts to the land of freedom.\nOne brave woman, Harriet Tubman,\n- the 'Moses' of our day, has visited\nthat land of darkness seven or eight\ntimes, & brought safely off over one\nhundred of her slave friends.\nThe millions of slaves not now\nwithin our military lines, know of the\ngood fortune of their fellows, and live\nin the faith that their day of jubilee is\nnear.
