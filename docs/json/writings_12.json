Our motive is to ask of\nyou, council in the formation, and cooperation in the\ncarrying out, of plans, which may produce a radical\nchange in our moral Atmosphere.\n\n[We, who call ourselves\nDaughters of Temperance, and who are united\ninto one Sisterhood, [by] for the promotion of our great\ncauses, the cause of Virtue, Love & Temperance,\n[have] do from week to week meet here to encourage\neach other in the way of well doing.\n\nWhile we have thus met together, one year has\nsped its course, one sun has rolled its circuit\nround, and the question [arises] rises asked us. What\ngood have you done, what better is society, that\nyou have thus sacrificed your time. What do you propose\ndoing? You can find no intemperate females in Canajoharie,\nwhom you may inform & surely there can be no]\n\n\n\n[possible necessity of your Order being longer sustained,\nnor need we be asked to join with you and\nlike you sacrifice our time for naught.\n\nI would that I were capable of answering such\nquestions in a manner that would carry conviction\nto the minds of all present, and cause them to feel\nthat wherever a great and public evil exists, [n] there\nindividual effort can avail [aught] but little in its removal.\n\nBut to the question, What good our Union\nhas done? I will say, that the circumstances under\nwhich we organized were indeed unpropitious, and that\nthe influence of those circumstances are still felt.\n\nOur numbers have increased but slowly, Those\nonly have joined us, who have been so fortunate as to have\nthe first and false impression of the object of our association, supplanted\nby a knowledge of our real purpose.\n\nThough we may not be able to tell you, or [to\ndiscover] ourselves to discover, where we, in any signal\nmanner, have advanced our Noble cause, though we\nat times have been almost disheartened in [our] hope of benefitting\nour fallen fellow beings, though, we both as a society and\nindividually, have been scandalized as being deficient in\nmental and moral capacity to farther the great\ncause we profess to love.] Though our [way] Order has been\nstrongly opposed, by ladies professing a desire to see\nthe moral condition of our race elevated, And though\nwe still see some of our thoughtless female friends whirling on\nin the giddy dance, with an intoxicated partner\nat [their] her sides, [though] and we more than this, see\nher [accompanying] accompany her reeling companion to some\nsecluded Nook & there quaff with him from\nthat virtue destroying cup.

We\nmust learn to estimate the worth of [the] a human\nsoul, We must feel, that wherever we behold a\nbeing wearing the impress of his Maker, there is one\nbrother & there is one who claims from us, kindness,\n& protection, How can we feel an interest about\nthose of whom we know nothing, & how are we to know,]\n\n\n[unless we associate together and inform ourselves\nof their wants and dangers. Could we truly\nestimate the extent of [individual] combined influence,\nthen could we calculate, how much the state\nof society may be advanced by even the most inferior\norganization.]\n\nIt is generally acceded that it is our sex\n[possesses] that [power of fashioning] fashions the social and\nmoral state of society, [and when we [view] look\naround us do we not see much that we are unwilling\nto believe is so through our influence?] We do\nnot presume that females possess unbounded\npower, in [breaking] abolishing the [evils] evil customs of\nthe day, but we do believe that were they en masse\nto discountenance the use of wine & brandy as a\nbeverage at both their public and private parties, not\none of the opposite sex, who has any claim to the\ntitle of Gentleman, would so insult them as to come into\ntheir presence after having quaffed of that foul\ndestroyer of all true delicacy and refinement.\n\nI am not aware that we have any inebriate\nfemales among us, but have we not those, who\nare fallen [to] from Virtue, and who claim our efforts for\ntheir reform, equally with the inebriate, and\nwhile we feel it our duty to extend the hand of\nsympathy & love to those who are wanderers from the\npath of Temperance, should we not be also\nzealous in [the] reclaiming [of] these poor deluded ones,\n[of our own sex] who have been robbed of their most precious Gem, virtue,\n& whom we blush to think belong to our sex.\n\nNow ladies, all we would do, is to do all in\nour power, both individually & collectively to [[?similar]]\nharmonize and happify our Social
