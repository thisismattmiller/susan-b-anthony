In the house of representatives the republicans will have a very large majority. As elected, the 356 members were divided politically as follows: Republicans, 245; democrats, 104; populists, 6; silver, 1. The republican majority was 134. There have been a few changes within the year, and when the vacancies are filled at the November elections and the roll is called the republican majority will vary a little from this figure.\nIn another column we print the list of the new senate, compiled from our own political records. It is the first full and correct list that has been published. The new senate will contain 42 republicans, 39 democrats, and 6 populists, and there is one vacancy - the seat formerly occupied by Anthony Higgins, of Delaware. The legislature of Delaware was republican on joint ballot but failed to make a legal election of a senator. Henry A. Dupont will claim the seat, but it is very doubtful if he can obtain it.", "summaryText": "The fifty-fourth congress will meet on the first Monday of December.
