The patient should first be removed to a cooler spot if possible, or at least where shade can be secured. The treatment should be begun at once. The clothing about the neck and body must either be loosened or removed. Cold is particularly indicated in cases where there is great heat of the body, and delirium and convulsive movements are present. This means of reducing the temperature may be applied in the shape of cracked ice about the head and spine, or the use of cold water. If the head of the body is very great, it may be necessary to wrap the patient in sheets wet with cold water. If there is, besides great heat, evidence of serious depression, stimulants must be used while the cold is being applied.", "summaryText": "Instructions on how to treat someone with sunstroke.", "similar": {"daybook": [[0.9984669156436959, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-004_00461_00683", "17_2"]], [0.8328130757979405, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-004_00231_00459", "19_3"]], [0.8301068521804584, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-004_00461_00683", "17_3"]], [0.8150295534937735, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-004_00231_00459", "19_5"]], [0.8142847264109455, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-004_00461_00683", "17_5"]], [0.8107536019928703, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-004_00461_00683", "17_6"]], [0.8102905283925208, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-004_00231_00459", "19_6"]], [0.8084550288902036, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-004_00231_00459", "19_8"]], [0.8064703717608142, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-004_00461_00683", "17_1"]], [0.8055921869833054, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-004_00461_00683", "17_8"]], [0.8042739002024721, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-004_00231_00459", "19_1"]], [0.8040978148889675, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-004_00461_00683", "18_1"]], [0.7950743198238167, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-004_00461_00683", "149_1"]], [0.7927348795877587, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-004_00231_00459", "20_1"]], [0.7916125243669203, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-004_00231_00459", "19_9"]], [0.7900164445935505, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-004_00461_00683", "17_9"]], [0.7899034895608864, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-004_00685_00905", "110_1"]], [0.7884525986326311, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-004_00685_00905", "18_1"]], [0.7861336893829285, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-004_00231_00459", "19_4"]]], "writings": [[0.770818758998981, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-006_00609_00651", "15_16_17"]], [0.7488194016976211, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00007_00058", "2_3_4"]], [0.7450430825270861, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-006_00652_00705", "6_7_8"]], [0.7429046653047399, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00161_00181", "5_6_7_8"]], [0.7424648384078887, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-006_00586_00608", "16_17"]], [0.7420833351905561, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00007_00058", "12_13_14_15"]], [0.7419403713016617, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00007_00058", "51_52"]], [0.7407980659470561, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-006_00586_00608", "7_8_9"]], [0.7406195298101295, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00114_00160", "6_7_8"]], [0.7403644494791477, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00007_00058", "8_9_10_11"]]], "correspondence": [[0.7261408378162288, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "202_203_204_205_206_207"]], [0.7209076024239038, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "111_112_113"]], [0.7172301697428052, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "155_156"]], [0.7113637890552078, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "224_225_226_227"]], [0.7086101325124091, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "59_60"]], [0.7022152381592583, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "85_86"]], [0.7007440298876053, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "138_139_140_141_142"]], [0.6993828944675482, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "21_22_23"]], [0.6978892862088277, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "122_123_124"]], [0.6976021036100055, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "173_174"]]]}, "digital_id": "mss11049.mss11049-004_00231_00459", "file_id": 19, "page": "https://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:mss:mss11049:mss11049-004:00249/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "entry_id": 2}
