WOOLRICH &amp; CO., Palmer, Mass.\n\nDr. Parkhurst on \"the New Woman.\"\nBut, whatever certain adventurous\nwomen may think about it, it is sufficiently\nclear that nature has certain\npretty decided opinions of its own on\nthe matter, and that nature has so\nwrought its opinions into the tissue of\nwoman's physical constitution and function\nthat any feminine attempt to mutiny\nagainst wifehood, motherhood and\ndomestic \"limitations\" is a hopeless\nand rather imbecile attempt to escape\nthe inevitable, writes the Rev. Charles\nH. Parkhurst in an article on \"The\nTrue Mission of Woman\" in the Ladies'\nHome Journal. All the female\ncongresses in the world might combine\nin colossal mass meeting and vote\nwith passionate show of hands that woman's\nsphere is coincident with the spherity\nof the globe or even all of the heavens,\nbut the very idiosyncrasy of her physical\nbuild and the limitations essentially\nbound up in it will sponge out her mass\nmeeting resolutions as fast as she can\npass them.\n\nIt is well enough for her to say that\nshe wishes she were a man, but she is\nnot, and till she is she might as well\nsuccumb to the fact that God and nature\nhad very different intentions for\nher from what he had for her brothers,\nand that he recorded his intentions in a\nway that he has taken some pains to prevent\nher from being able to forget. I am really\nsorry for those women that wish\nthey were men. I wish they were. It\nwould be such a relief to the rest of us\nas well as to them.", "summaryText": "An advertisement for RIDGES FOOD and an article by Dr. Parkhurst on the limitations of women's physical constitution and function.", "similar": {"daybook": [[0.8312940614799076, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-004_00231_00459", "89_2"]], [0.8260188459608271, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-003_00450_00548", "76_2"]], [0.8221080942735445, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-003_00768_00999", "194_1"]], [0.821200868395588, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-003_00768_00999", "221_1"]], [0.8202795666054892, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-002_00107_00307", "124_1"]], [0.8201108211479381, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00683_00886", "105_1"]], [0.8197144056442489, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-002_00764_01001", "119_1"]], [0.819186138030616, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-004_00685_00905", "133_1"]], [0.8173716237831186, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-003_00551_00767", "193_1"]], [0.8159017370858035, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00683_00886", "50_2"]], [0.8153485121061071, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-002_00764_01001", "106_1"]], [0.8147327924520184, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-004_00461_00683", "157_1"]], [0.8145663650549437, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00887_00956", "38_2"]], [0.8138825558897509, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00683_00886", "144_1"]], [0.8132038469197134, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-004_00461_00683", "195_2"]], [0.8131328801932121, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00683_00886", "51_1"]], [0.8127563955436646, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-002_00764_01001", "120_2"]], [0.8126582874933339, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-002_00008_00105", "51_6"]], [0.8122788794562102, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-002_00764_01001", "117_1"]]], "writings": [[0.8554786282754251, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00059_00113", "21_22_23"]], [0.8540642123967569, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00242_00289", "7_8_9"]], [0.8518080889514761, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00059_00113", "9_10_11"]], [0.8499115971048594, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00242_00289", "38_39_40"]], [0.8450528589490639, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00007_00058", "40_41_42_43_44"]], [0.8427507692958106, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00059_00113", "39_40_41"]], [0.8392160835359113, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00059_00113", "24_25_26"]], [0.8388647395150385, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-006_00586_00608", "7_8_9"]], [0.8352519717197225, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00059_00113", "42_43_44"]], [0.8342581759087534, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-006_00586_00608", "18_19_20"]]], "correspondence": [[0.8141145220996395, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "30_31_32_33_34_35"]], [0.8114456706026989, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "15_16_17_18_19_20"]], [0.8106400749094633, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "41_42_43"]], [0.8082407658017235, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "173_174"]], [0.8073365366355095, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "27_28_29"]], [0.8070683316152165, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "89_90"]], [0.8068471964054751, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "25_26"]], [0.8059454054513062, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "155_156"]], [0.8053925678048182, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "97_98"]], [0.804711522358186, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "54_55_56_57_58"]]]}, "digital_id": "mss11049.mss11049-003_00768_00999", "file_id": 221, "page": "https://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:mss:mss11049:mss11049-003:00988/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "entry_id": 2}
