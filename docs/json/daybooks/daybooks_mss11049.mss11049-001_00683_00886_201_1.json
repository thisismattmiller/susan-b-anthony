Anthony last Tuesday evening on the occasion of her fiftieth birthday. At an early hour hour the parlors were filled with ladies and gentlemen. Among the many present were the [Ve?]nerable Hon. Samuel E. Sewall and wife of [?] Mrs. Phelps, Mrs. Ames, Mrs. Randall, Miss Stanton, Miss Cary, Mrs. Black, Mrs. Norton, Mrs. Blake, and Mrs. Tilton. Mrs. Randall read a birthday ode composed for the occasion by Miss Phoebe Cary. Mrs. Ames recited Poe's \"Raven\" finely, and Mrs. Randall declaimed the \"Bells\". Miss Anthony made a characteristic speech. She said \"Public Sentiment everywhere demanded women suffrage, and so she was dumb, though she still found voice to ask them to work. She wanted all to join in and demand a sixteenth amendment. When the secretary of state shall proclaim that twenty-eight states have ratified that amendment, then Susan B. Anthony would stop work and not before.\" We subjoin Miss Cary's ode: TO MISS SUSAN B. ANTHONY, ON HER FIFTIETH BIRTHDAY. We touch our caps, and place to-night The victor's wreath upon her, To woman who outranks us all In courage and in honor. While others in domestic broils Have proved, by word and carriage, That one of the United States Is not the state of marriage. She, caring not for loss of men, Nor for the world's confusion, Has carried on a civil war, And made a Revolution! True, other women have been brave When banded or hus-banded; But she has bravely fought her way Alone and single-handed. And think of her unselfish strength, Her generous disposition, Who never made a lasting prop Out of a proposition. She might have chose an honored name, And none have scorned or hissed it; Have written Mrs. Jones or Smith, But, strange to say, she missed it. For fifty years to come may she Grow rich, and ripe, and mellow, Be quoted even above \"par,\" Or any other fellow! And speak the truth from pole to pole, And keep her light a-burning, Before she cuts her stick to go The way there's no returning. Because her motto, grand, hath been The right of every human, And first and last, and right or wrong, She takes the side of woman. \"A perfect woman, nobly planned,\" To aid, not to amuse one, Take her for all in all, we ne'er Shall see the match for Susan!", "similar": {"daybook": [[0.88060972429687, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-003_00768_00999", "175_1"]], [0.8712548253326468, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-003_00008_00223", "38_2"]], [0.864019384450951, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-004_00008_00230", "138_2"]], [0.8632844431288632, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00519_00682", "114_1"]], [0.8619327230823751, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-004_00231_00459", "44_1"]], [0.8617718112053869, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-002_00764_01001", "46_1"]], [0.8600667869089094, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00887_00956", "53_3"]], [0.8600374741712682, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-004_01051_01246", "138_2"]], [0.8580175156955308, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-002_00107_00307", "81_1"]], [0.8573365223773557, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-004_00008_00230", "55_2"]], [0.856856756591617, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-004_00461_00683", "173_1"]], [0.8560717917360989, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00519_00682", "113_2"]], [0.8550354693822286, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-003_00551_00767", "22_2"]], [0.8546643959868935, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-003_00551_00767", "67_1"]], [0.8524165872944385, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-003_00551_00767", "106_2"]], [0.8509619107229348, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-003_00768_00999", "194_1"]], [0.8503921339725606, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-004_00231_00459", "39_1"]], [0.8502659212445656, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-003_00768_00999", "179_2"]], [0.8500974601661003, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-002_00764_01001", "96_1"]]], "writings": [[0.878173809373935, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-006_00586_00608", "1_2_3_4"]], [0.8697543998825241, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00242_00289", "18_19_20_21"]], [0.86630009179062, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-006_00572_00573", "1_2"]], [0.8660393734631917, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00059_00113", "1_2_3_4"]], [0.8638092685543342, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00114_00160", "1_2_3_4_5"]], [0.860827240783871, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-006_00574_00585", "5_6"]], [0.8600400927852715, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00161_00181", "1_2_3_4"]], [0.8572012561143241, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-006_00574_00585", "12"]], [0.8514552400252889, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00228_00241", "1_2_3_4"]], [0.8464409316542882, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-006_00586_00608", "18_19_20"]]], "correspondence": [[0.8921337974849763, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "114_115_116_117_118"]], [0.890083915637676, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "132_133_134_135_136_137"]], [0.8867717431849022, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "130_131"]], [0.8853486283675778, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "162_163"]], [0.8849125601731915, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "150_151_152"]], [0.8835869034125546, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "21_22_23"]], [0.8821514404213471, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "187"]], [0.8799989184692554, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "153"]], [0.8793364391743486, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "46_47_48"]], [0.878280497727139, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "168_169_170"]]]}, "digital_id": "mss11049.mss11049-001_00683_00886", "file_id": 201, "page": "https://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:mss:mss11049:mss11049-001:00883/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "entry_id": 1}
