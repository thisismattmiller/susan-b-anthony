In view,\nhowever, of the feelings of the members on\nthe subject he suggested the following resolution,\nwhich was adopted:\nResolved. That we do accept the resignation of\nRev. Mr. Mann conditionally, hoping he will, after\na few months' rest, return here and find a warmer\nwelcome than anywhere else in the world.\nThe conditions are that he shall report to\nthe trustees of the church his ability or inability\nto return in time for them to know\nwhat the church may depend on for a pastor\nafter the summer vacation. During the\nmonth of June and until the second Sunday\nin July, some one will have to officiate as\npastor, and such selection as the trustees may\nmake will be entirely satisfactory to the\ncongregation. At the suggestion of Justice\nAngle, the following resolution was adopted:\nResolved. That the trustees of the church be\ndelegated to communicate to Mr. Mann our regret\nthat the conditions of his health necessitates such\naction, and to convey to him the assurance of the\nundivided respect, esteem and love of the society\nfor him, and our appreciation of the manner in\nwhich he has discharged the duties of his high\noffice while he was been our pastor.\nThe meeting then adjourned. The trustees\nare J. A. Hinds, E. T. Curtis, S. Brewster,\nDr. Porter Farley, Samuel Wilder, J. V.\nAlexander and G. H. Smith.", "summaryText": "The gentlemen present discussed a plan to accept the resignation of Rev.
