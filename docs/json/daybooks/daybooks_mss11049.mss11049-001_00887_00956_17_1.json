It seems to me that the incidents of my early life are important only as they are related to those of later life and that in writing of things long past it is not necessary to enter into minute details. My birthplace was South Adams, a town in the western part of Massachusetts, near the New York line. My father, Daniel Anthony, was a cotton manufacturer in that town and in the neighboring town of Hoosick Falls, just over the line in New York State. My mother was Lucy Read. I was the second child in a family of seven. My earliest recollection is of hearing a sermon read by my father in the Congregational Church in which he was then interested. I was then between three and four years old. My next recollection is of walking with my mother and older sister Sally from the little old red schoolhouse up the hill to the new and larger one which replaced it. I was then between four and five years old. I remember that I was much pleased with the new schoolhouse and especially with the stove, which was so high that I could stand erect in the oven. I was then so small that the top of the desk was above my shoulders. I could not write, but I listened to the writing lesson and envied the children who were able to make the beautiful letters. I was then between five and six years old. I remember that I was very much interested in the geography lesson and in the maps and that I learned to read quite readily. I was then between six and seven years old. I remember that I was very much interested in the geography lesson and in the maps and that I learned to read quite readily.
