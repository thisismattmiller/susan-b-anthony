{"dateText": "April 9, 1895", "dateFormated": "1895-04-09", "cityOrState": "Omaha, Neb.", "geographicalLocations": [""], "people": ["Judge Scott"], "fullText": "Judge Scott made a declaration in court to day which means a discontinuance of the system of regularly fining women of the town. A woman was brought into court who had failed to pay her fine. These fines are levied by the police, although there is a state law prohibiting prostitution, Judge Scott dismissed the case, saying:\n\"I do not propose to sit on this bench and aid the city to manufacture prostitutes.\nIt is called a fine, but is, in face, a license, a legalizing of this destruction and sale of female virtue. This poor woman, however bad, is not as bad as the officials who inaugurated this damnable practice, who set a price on virtue, and then hound and persecute them for the pitiful $8 per month. So long as I sit on this District Court bench, my voice and my power will be against this manufacture of vice and sin. I see in it nothing but a blackmailing scheme. If the women do not respond to the blackmail the police prosecute them, not under the law, but they frame a charge and call them vagrants. This practice is abominable and will not be countenanced.\"\nThe prosecutor stated that these fines went to the school fund, but Judge Scott said that was no excuse. It reflected no credit upon a city to have its children educated at the expense of fallen virtue.\nThe effect of this decision frees all prostitutes from paying this fine, and they can refuse to pay it if they choose. It is probable that Scott will order the arrest of the officer accepting this fine.", "summaryText": "Judge Scott made a declaration in court to day which means a discontinuance of the system of regularly fining women of the town.", "similar": {"daybook": [[0.8275447916810944, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-002_00107_00307", "99_1"]], [0.8236537395904855, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-002_01003_01109", "24_1"]], [0.8227612581240604, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-002_00008_00105", "43_6"]], [0.8224629746931001, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-002_00764_01001", "120_2"]], [0.8218471313529921, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-004_00461_00683", "146_2"]], [0.8194128350360375, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-002_00107_00307", "26_1"]], [0.8148192388674296, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-002_00008_00105", "26_6"]], [0.811579324165129, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00519_00682", "26_2"]], [0.8109062419794797, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-002_00409_00631", "72_1"]], [0.8108255415844099, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00887_00956", "32_2"]], [0.8107393519300021, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-003_00768_00999", "55_2"]], [0.8101775563336074, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-002_00633_00763", "28_1"]], [0.809781201319834, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00683_00886", "121_1"]], [0.8096697975414744, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-002_00107_00307", "122_1"]], [0.8095370881173282, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-002_00008_00105", "19_2"]], [0.8092844617886505, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-002_00107_00307", "43_1"]], [0.808674777444757, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-002_00008_00105", "25_6"]], [0.8082466592984039, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00519_00682", "162_1"]], [0.8072728668491458, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-002_00409_00631", "155_1"]]], "writings": [[0.8402693467634088, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-006_00652_00705", "41_42_43_44"]], [0.8374079481972734, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-006_00652_00705", "37_38_39_40"]], [0.81846406019555, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-006_00586_00608", "5_6"]], [0.8170707949682703, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-006_00586_00608", "21_22"]], [0.817065866590007, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-006_00609_00651", "41_42_43"]], [0.8138471185651446, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-006_00652_00705", "24_25_26_27"]], [0.813349545224287, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-006_00652_00705", "9_10_11_12"]], [0.8126300126143293, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-006_00586_00608", "7_8_9"]], [0.8122843202093493, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00007_00058", "45_46_47"]], [0.8107950066710542, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-006_00652_00705", "34_35_36"]]], "correspondence": [[0.7989525458957388, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "224_225_226_227"]], [0.7918012147772162, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "36_37_38_39_40"]], [0.7887515836897807, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "111_112_113"]], [0.7776028935808387, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "132_133_134_135_136_137"]], [0.7772612334848021, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "27_28_29"]], [0.7768079373440344, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "85_86"]], [0.7767126501122316, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "15_16_17_18_19_20"]], [0.7748980467649513, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "114_115_116_117_118"]], [0.7744929142810751, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "72_73_74_75"]], [0.7725392045011366, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "173_174"]]]}, "digital_id": "mss11049.mss11049-003_00768_00999", "file_id": 220, "page": "https://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:mss:mss11049:mss11049-003:00987/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "entry_id": 2}
