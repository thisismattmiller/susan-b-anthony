This is the fate\nof the once noted Virginia Penny, who filled\nthe whole of the United States with praises of\nher unceasing efforts to raise women to a better\nsphere of action, with such grand and\nglorious results.\n\nWhen Virginia first began her work not\nmore than six roads of industry were open to\nwomen; to-day there are about four hundred\nchannels in which respectable women can\nearn an independent livelihood.\n\nWhat can women do? was the cry that was\nfirst started by Miss Penny, and made answer\nfrom every department of men's labor. She\nworked for years with untiring zeal, regardless\nof home comforts and bodily health, devoting\nall her substance, time, and brains, to\nthe one object, that was benefitting her sister\nwomen.\n\nShe searched both America and Europe\nthrough for the materials to give her the\npower to inform women of the different\nmechanical industries, arts, and professions,\nin which they might gradually enter, and be\npaid fair salaries, such as would enable them\nto lead independent lives.\n\nAmerican women who love freedom as they\ndo the air they breathe, saw her work was\ngood, and immediately took advantage of the\nbright prospects which she was offering\nthem and filled the places, one by one, so well\nand efficiently, that there is not a position today\nfrom the church, the bar, the press, and\nmedicine, to the hundreds of simpler industries,\nbut what are successfully filled by them.\n\nBut while the world has been going on and\nwomen have been comfortably enjoying the\nfruits of Miss Penny's time, thought, labor,\nmoney, and health, the hand that applied that\ntorch and lit the fire, has gradually sunk\nlower and lower into penury. The years\nhave rolled on, her home is gone, her helpful\nkin are dead, and she is no longer young.\nThe wealth that she might have spent in her\nown selfish ease and the gratification of cultivated\ntastes, was nobly and unselfishly given\nto help others. Now she is in need and requires\ntheir help in return for the bare means\nof subsistence. There is an old adage, \"Many\ncan help one, but one cannot help many.\"\nYet Miss Penny has shown that a great deal\ncan be accomplished by one woman, if she\nsets to work in the right way, for she alone\nhas helped thousands.\n\nWe therefore send out an appeal to our\nAmerican mothers and sisters, and beg of\nthem to help in return one who has done so\nmuch for them, by giving to her from their\nsubstance, as God has blessed them, and to\nraise a fund sufficient to give her in her old\nage the necessaries and comforts of life. Also\nto show the world that the mothers and\ndaughters of America known how to be generous\nas well as grateful, not to wait till she is\ndead, and then raise a monument to her memory,\nbut to cheer her last days and to make\nher feel that numberless women bless her for\nher struggles and sacrifices.\n\nAs Miss Penny is literally without a home,\neven temporary relief would be gratefully\nreceived, with the hope that more substantial\naid will follow. Miss Penny is really unfit to\nwork, and it should never be said in coming\nhistory that such a benefactor of her age had\nbeen allowed to suffer from neglect and want.\nThe Union Dime Savings Institution, Broadway,\nThirty-second Street and Sixth Avenue,\nNew York City, will receive for Miss Penny\nany contributions.
