Eliza Ballou Garfield was born Sept. 25, 1802, at the foot of Mount Monadnock, New Hampshire, and married Abram Garfield, of Watertown, Mass., in 1827, coming to Orange, Cuyahoga county, O., 1834, when her eldest child, Thomas Gar-field, now of Grand Rapids, Mich, was 6 years of age. She was a woman of strong sense and spirit, and had a singular capacity for managing and educating children. Her care and energy produced one of America's greatest public men and carried the family in respectable poverty to the point where it could make its own way. James A. Garfield was her pride and joy, and she has aged very rapidly from the day that Guiteau's bullet struck him down.", "summaryText": "Grandma Garfield died at the Garfield homestead at Mentor at 5 o'clock Saturday morning.
