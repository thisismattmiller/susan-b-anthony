Mann's Resignation Last Night.\n\nThe call for a special meeting of the members\nof the First Unitarian Church Society\nlast night for the purpose of taking action on\nthe resignation of the pastor, brought out\nvery few people. It is doubtful if half the\nnumber would have ventured out had the\nbusiness to be transacted been on less importance\nto the congregation.\nThe meeting was called to order by Mr.\nWilder, who suggested that Justice Angle be\nrequested to act as chairman, and G. H.\nSmith secretary. On taking the chair Justice\nAngle addressed the members in a very brief\nand fitting manner, as to the cause of calling\nthem together, and as he expressed it, a\nsorrowful occasion. It brought to his mind\nvividly reccollections of the past, and his\npersonal respect for Mr. Mann during\nthe long time he had officiated as pastor\nof the society. In all that time\nhe had never known him to have aught but\nthe good of the society at heart, and his\nteaching had always been strictly on the subject\nof morality. He regretted that Mr.\nMann was compelled to ask the church to\nrelieve him on account of his failing health,\nand hoped that whatever action was taken\non the subject of his resignation, it would be\ndone with the same spirit that prompted\nMr. Mann to offer it.\nThe letter containing the resignation was\nthen read. It was dated January 16, 1888,\nand reviewed briefly his connection with the\nchurch, and his final determination to unconditionally\noffer his resignation to take effect\nJune 1st.\nSome discussion was indulged in by the\ngentlemen present, and it seemed to be the\ndesire of all to devise some plan whereby its\nacceptance would not compel them to abandon\nall hope of Mr. Mann's returning at the\nend of a few months in a better physical condition,\nand resume his pastorate without it\nbeing necessary to issue another call to him.\nMr. Wilder was satisfied from what he could\nlearn from a personal interview on that point\nwith Mr. Mann that such conditions could never\nbe considered by him, for although he had\nnot contemplated accepting any other call,\nhe felt that he could never return. In view,\nhowever, of the feelings of the members on\nthe subject he suggested the following resolution,\nwhich was adopted:\nResolved. That we do accept the resignation of\nRev. Mr. Mann conditionally, hoping he will, after\na few months' rest, return here and find a warmer\nwelcome than anywhere else in the world.\n", "summaryText": "The First Unitarian Church Society held a special meeting to discuss the resignation of Rev.
