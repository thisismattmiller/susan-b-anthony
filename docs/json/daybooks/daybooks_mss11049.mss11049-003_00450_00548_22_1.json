A broken shaft, as surmised, was the cause of the delay, and she has been seventeen days under sail, making her way slowly across the Pacific. The steamer San Juan, sent out only yesterday on a search expedition, passed her during the night, but early this morning the tug Vigiland forty miles out sighted the Peking, and soon had her in tow. As it was very rough just outside the Golden Gate, the steamer was not brought in until this afternoon. Then Telegraph Hill and the entire water front, was black with people who witnessed her arrival. Fully twenty thousand voices cheered when she came abreast of the city front. A visit to the vessel showed, as suspected, that the shaft was broken, and broken in the sleeve very near the propellor, in a position that could not be reached. The accident occurred at 7 o'clock on the morning on January 21st, when ten days out from Yokohoma. She at once proceeded to make this port under sail. It was impossible to repair the shaft and the propellor was nearly lost, hanging somewhat loosely behind, and acting as a drag. The entire distance, to within sight of port, was made under sail. The best days record was 119 miles, and she was seventeen days under sail. The northern course was taken, in the hope that she might meet the China, but no vessel was sighted until off this port. As a somewhat zigzag course had to be taken under sail the entire distance traversed was longer than that taken by a vessel under steam, being 1,340 miles. Everybody on board was well and the steamer looked as trim and neat as though nothing had happened. The Pacific mail officers cursed loud and deep over the hard luck that led the San Juan to miss the Peking. Spreckles, who is always fortunate in finding vessels, will clean up a large amount of salvage.", "summaryText": "The City of Peking steamer arrived in San Francisco after being seventeen days under sail due to a broken shaft near the propellor.
