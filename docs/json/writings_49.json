Lebbeus\nArmstrong, of Moreau, Saratoga County\ndeemed it necessary to banish distilled\nliquors only, thus, wine, Cider and\nBeer were continued the every\nday beverages of those truly noble\nmen and their followers.- Hundreds\nand thousands of the drunken of the\nrace gladly sought redemption from2\ntheir thralldom to Rum, and adopted\nthe Pledge which required\nAbstinence from Distilled Liquors only.\n- It soon became evident, that\nthough the pledges of their converts\nwere kept inviolate, still\nwere there large proportions of their\nnumbers found among the drunken.\nThe idea of Total Abstinence\nwas first advanced in the\nyear 1811, at Litchfield Ct. by\nDr. Lyman Beecher. The Society\nof which he was a member, appointed\na committee to report\nwhat could be done to stay the\nprogress of Intemperance, - The report\nwas made, & after lamenting the\nwide spread danger, discouragingly said\nthere seemed to be no feasible3\nremedy. The Dr moved that the Com.\nbe discharged, & that another be appointed\nto report instanter, a remedy\nfor Intemperance - he was\nmade Chairman & reported resolutions\nat once, recommending to all Christians\n& good men, the immediate\n& entire abandonment of all intoxicating\nLiquors- the report was\nadopted, & here, it is believed,\nwas the first step taken in the\ngreat history of Total Abstinence.\nLong years elapsed though, before\nthis new doctrine [of Total Abstinence]\nfound favor with any considerable\nnumber of those who professed to be\nboth good men & Christians.
