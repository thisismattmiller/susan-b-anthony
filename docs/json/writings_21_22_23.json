Anthony\nSpeeches & Writings File\n'Judge Taney' 1861Judge Taney\n1861The decision of Judge Taney, that 'Black men have no rights which white men are bound to respect,' is not, after all, so wide off the mark. It is but the reflection of the spirit and practice of the American people.\nAll over our country, in the nominally Free states if the North, as well as the slave-owning states of the South, the rights of the black men are disregarded, trampled under the foot of the white man.\nIn the southern half of this [slavery accursed- strike through] Union, [there are nearly Four Millions of- strike through] native born [citizens, so called black- strike through] men, women & children, [who- strike through] fromthe very hour of their birth, are defrauded of every right to life, liberty & the pursuit of happiness. And this too, by the sanction of both Church and state.\n\nIn the Fifteen slave-owning states of the south, there are Four millions of so called black men please to remember, that very many of them, have faces as white as yours or mine - the result of the terrible wholesale system of licentiousness practiced there - who have no right to their own persons, no right to the earnings of their own hands, no right to the development of their own intellects, no right to the exercise of theirown consciences and wills, no right to any of the sacred relations of life. The holy ties of husband & wife, parents & children, brothers & sisters, may be severed at any moment, at the will of the tyrant master. Not a thought, word, action or aspiration, can the slave call his own, all, ALL are the property of another.\n\nYes: in those fifteen slave states, there are four millions of human beings, in many of whose veins courses the proud saxon blood of Virginia's noblest sons, who are driven to unpaid toil, from the rising to the setting of the sun, who4\nare beaten in body, and lacerated\nin spirit, - who are\nbought and sold in the market,\nwith as little regard to family\nties, as the farmer evinces in the\nsale of horses & sheep. And if,\nperchance, any show discontent,\nand rise in rebellion to such\ngalling bondage, or with fleeing\nfootstep turn northward to Victoria's\nAsylum for the oppressed, they\nare hunted with blood hounds,\nshot dead by the slave hunter,\nhung by the dozzens, without Judge\nor Jury - nay more, burned\nalive \u2014 And all these terrible\ncrimes may be perpetrated upon\nthe [blacks, In the] black men & women\nand children of the South, with", "similar": {"daybook": [[0.8373947559043036, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00683_00886", "201_1"]], [0.8331264518495337, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00239_00348", "36_1"]], [0.8299991322737188, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-003_00008_00223", "25_2"]], [0.8254666583684347, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-004_00461_00683", "146_2"]], [0.8236212274028678, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-002_00107_00307", "50_1"]], [0.8214998675222693, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-002_00008_00105", "43_5"]], [0.8192566337523699, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00349_00517", "165_1"]], [0.8184059763724807, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00349_00517", "124_1"]], [0.8181074501325857, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-003_00008_00223", "122_1"]], [0.8180109796004773, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-002_00308_00407", "32_4"]], [0.8170374935920264, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00683_00886", "53_2"]], [0.8166517099660262, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-002_00107_00307", "150_2"]], [0.8163780456935631, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-002_00409_00631", "186_1"]], [0.8156115913422447, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-003_00008_00223", "38_2"]], [0.8155516175133841, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00349_00517", "54_1"]], [0.8154849157913492, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-002_00107_00307", "119_2"]], [0.8149538191579394, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-003_00768_00999", "36_2"]], [0.8146249349094767, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-003_00768_00999", "194_1"]], [0.8142610630313544, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00519_00682", "35_2"]], [0.8138904321117892, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00519_00682", "113_2"]]], "writings": [[0.9083073445736494, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00205_00227", "18_19_20"]], [0.8758846942035738, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00161_00181", "1_2_3_4"]], [0.8748389323443847, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00205_00227", "7_8_9_10"]], [0.8720975676262583, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00199_00204", "1_2_3_4"]], [0.8695273420869815, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00228_00241", "1_2_3_4"]], [0.8692923142615773, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00182_00198", "1_2_3_4_5"]], [0.8661213496691689, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00205_00227", "21_22_23"]], [0.8609864444042931, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00205_00227", "11_12_13_14"]], [0.8564610988848406, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-006_00586_00608", "1_2_3_4"]], [0.8515915047770591, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00114_00160", "1_2_3_4_5"]], [0.84981418669608, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-006_00572_00573", "1_2"]], [0.8443639058844268, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00161_00181", "5_6_7_8"]], [0.8434960889179303, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00059_00113", "1_2_3_4"]], [0.8433092098787426, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00228_00241", "9_10_11_12"]], [0.8423258559553886, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00161_00181", "15_16_17_18"]], [0.8413664341167646, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00199_00204", "5_6"]], [0.8387133068469821, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00161_00181", "19_20_21"]], [0.836143075596752, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-006_00652_00705", "1_2_3_4_5"]], [0.834828877360908, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00205_00227", "15_16_17"]]], "correspondence": [[0.8277722224547461, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "102_103"]], [0.827729880012474, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "46_47_48"]], [0.8248414469492344, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "54_55_56_57_58"]], [0.824104361104597, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "89_90"]], [0.8207715177188456, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "153"]], [0.8207513802435851, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "114_115_116_117_118"]], [0.8195816109185515, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "21_22_23"]], [0.8194506754961349, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "70_71"]], [0.8192777316785915, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "97_98"]], [0.8191199148463821, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "224_225_226_227"]]]}, "digital_id": "mss11049.mss11049-007_00205_00227", "pages": "1_2_3_4_5_6"}, {"text": "5\nperfect impunity, provided, none\nbut slaves witness the deed. -\nFor, by the Laws of the Slave\nStates, the testimony of a slave\nagainst his master, or any white\nperson, is not allowed in the\nCourts.
