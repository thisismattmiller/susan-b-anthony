Natl] Teachers Convention held in Troy, [N.Y.] August 9, 1856*]\nMrs. Stanton. [?]\n\nMr. President\nGentlemen & Ladies.\n[Has been copied.]\n\nThe subject\nupon which I am to address you, requires\na more extended survey of the objects &\npurposes of life, than the mere question\nproposed seems to involve. Is it desirable\nthat the sexes be educated together?\n\nThis subject may be presented\nin a variety of phases, each depending on\nthe peculiar view of the mind entertaining it.\n\nIn regard to all those speculations,\nbased on the common theory, that\nman & woman are two distinct creations, -\ndiffering in all their manifestations of mind &\nbody, - placed here for a different purpose,\n& to fulfil a different destiny, I have nothing to say.\n\nThe view that I shall present(I would not make any concession or\napology.)\n\n\n2\nto you must be taken from quite another\n& opposite stand point.\n\nIt is far from my\nintention to introduce here any unpleasant\ntopic, or to refer needlessly to] the [odious] subject\ntechnically termed 'Woman's Rights'.\n\nI simply claim that latitude in\nthe presentation of my subject, that a full\ndiscussion of the question logically demands. -\n\nIf in doing so, I wound the sensibilities\nor shock the prejudices of any present, I\nbeg them to remember, that in every human\nsoul there is bound up much truth & error.\nfa who can say I possess all truth and am free from all error-\n\nGive me, therefore, a patient hearing\nfor the truths I bring you, & let my errors\npass from your minds like chaff before the winds.\n\n[Begin] I propose to present my\nthoughts under the three following heads. -\n1st The Identity of the sexes.-",

-- & which\nso far from proving them different makes\nboth the more perfectly & completely one.\n\nThis sexuality in no way affects the indi-\nvidual manifestations of mind or body.\n'Behold man eats,

[& dupto]?\n\nThis is no new idea, but was\nadvanced in the last century, as fully as the most\nradical of us now claim it. The Rev. Sidney Smith\none of the most rigorous & factious writers among British7\nEssayists, says on this point. -- 'A great deal\nhas been [said] made of the original difference of\ncapacity between men & women; - as if women\nwere more quick, & men more judicious, - as\nif women were more remarkable for delicacy\nof association, & men for stronger powers of attention.-\nAll this, we confess, appears to us very fanciful.-\nThat there is a difference in the understandings\nof [the] men & women, we every day meet with, every\nbody, we suppose, must perceive; - but there is\nnone, surely, which may not be accounted for\nby the difference of circumstances in which they\nhave been placed, without referring to any conjectural\ndifference of original conformation of mind.- As\nlong as boys & girls run about in the dirt, trundle\nhoop together, they are both precisely alike.- If you\ncatch up one half of these creatures & train them\nto a particular set of actions & opinions, & the other\nhalf to a perfectly opposite set, of course their under-8\nstandings will differ, as one or the other sort\nof occupations has called this or that talent into action-\nThere is no occasion, surely, to go into deeper or more\nabstruse reasoning, in order to prove so very simple a phenomenon'.\n\nThis same thought has been\nmore fully elaborated by one of the most scientific\nminds of our own day.- 'Intellectually\nconsidered', says our author, 'the woman is a man.-\nShe has all the mental capacities of a man.-\nShe has memory, reason, & imagination, which as\nBacon tells us, constitute all that belongs to mind.-\nShe has the same sensibilities, the same emotions\n& desires, as a man. - She has a will entirely like\nhis.- The laws of all these functions of the\nsoul are the same in both. - The work of education,\ntherefore, which consists in expanding all\nthese common powers, is emphatically one. -\n\n[There are some people, however,\nwho think, that as there is some acknowledged]",
