Hampshire, to recover his\nescaped Slave Woman Inez.\nAnd Jefferson, author of\nthe immortal declaration of 1776,\nwho said, 'I tremble for my country\nwhen I remember that God is just, and\nthat his justice may not sleep forever; ' -\n- Jefferson, who said, 'One hour of\nAmerican Slavery is fraught with\nmore misery, than ages of that\nwhich we rose in rebellion to oppose', -\nwas [not only only] a slave-holder\nto the day of his death, [but was]\nthe father [of], a slave daughter,\nwho was sold in the New\nOrleans Market for a thousand dollars.3\nYes, Jefferson, who uttered\nso many noble words for freedom,\nand so many scathing denunciations\nagainst slavery, was the\nfather of a Slave Mothers child,\nthe father of a Daughter to\nwhom he bequeathed, unrequited\ntoil, hopeless bondage, outraged\nperson, violated womanhood;\nThe father of a Daughter, whom\nhe made heir to the terrible fate\nof slavery; One hour of which,\nhe had declared, fraught with\nmore misery, than ages of that\nwhich the Revolutionary Fathers rose\nin rebellion to oppose, and to\nescape which, they fought and bled\nand died.

the trembling fugitive,\nwho asks protection at\nhis hands? \u2014 - Were Mr. Giddings\nown wife & daughter, among the outraged\nslave victims, think you, he\ncould be prevailed upon, to pledge11\nhimself, by all that is sacred,\non Earth, and in Heaven, to\nhelp inviolate the Pro-Slavery\nCompromises of the Constitution\nincluding the 'Fugitive Slave\nLaw,' and 'Dred Scott Decision,'?\nFor, according to Mr. Giddings\nown declaration, that the 'United\nStates Supreme Court is the high\ntribunal, authorized to give construc-\ntion to the Constitution, that abominable\nLaw, and that infamous\ndecision, are as much a part\nand parcel of the Constitution,\nas any line of the original parchment.\nWhat does Mr. Giddings mean,\nwhen he, with his hand on the\nBible, solemnly swears to support\nthe Unites States Constitution?12\n\nAnd Charles Sumner\nsays, 'It is true that there were\ncompromises at the formation of\nthe Constitution, which were subject\nof anxious debate.\n\nThere was a compromise,\nbetween the small and large States,\nby which equality was secured to all\nthe States, in the Senate. -\n\nThere was another compromise,\nfinally carried, under threats from\nthe south, on the motion of a New England\nmember, by which the Slave States were\nallowed representatives, according to the\nwhole number of Free persons, and 'three\nfifths of all other persons', - thus securing\npolitical power on account of their\nSlaves, in consideration that direct\ntaxes should be apportioned in the same way.", "similar":
