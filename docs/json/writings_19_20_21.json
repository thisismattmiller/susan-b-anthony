She left\n$15,000 to Harvard College to endow a Professorship\nof Moral Philosophy,- $30,000 to the Salem Athanaeum,\n& $30,000 to found a farm school at Salem for boys.-\nCatharine Beecher, in a letter to the last\nAnnual meeting of the 'American Woman's\nEducational Association, says, during the four years\nin which our Association has existed, more\nthan $100,000 have been given by our American\nwomen to increase the professional advantages\nof the other sex;- enough to establish & endow\nfive, such institutions as we aim to provide for\ngirls; & yet the first endowment for even one\nis yet to be received.\nAnd it will be seen that plans are now in operation\nto raise hundreds of thousands the coming year, to\nendow Professorships for men, & to add to the\nadvantages of rich colleges; & that for this, in proportion\nto their means, women will be more relied on than men.'\n1\nWe are assembled here\nthis evening, for the purpose\nof discussing the question of\nAmerican Slavery: -- The\nstartling fact that there are in\nthese United States, under the\nsanction of this professedly Chris-\ntian Republican Government, nearly\nFour Millions of human beings now\nclanking the chains of Slavery.-\nFour Millions of men and women\nand children, who are owned like\nhorses and cattle,- and bought and\nsold in the Market.- Four\nMillions of thinking, acting, conscious\nbeings, like ourselves, driven to unpaid\ntoil, from the rising to the setting\nof the sun, through the weary(2)\ndays and years of their wretched\nlife times.\nLet us, my Friends, for the\npassing hour, make the slaves\ncase our own. \u2014 As much as\nin us lies, let us feel that it is\nourselves, and our 'kith & kin',\nwho are despoiled of our inalienable\nright to life, liberty & the pursuit of happiness;\n- - that it is our own backs, that\nare bared to the slave-drivers lash; -\nthat it is our own flesh that is\nlacerated & torn, \u2014 that it is our\nown life blood that is poured\nout. --- Let us feel\nthat it is our own children, that\nare ruthlessly torn from our yearning\nmother hearts, & driven in the\n'coffle gang', through burning suns,", "similar": {"daybook":
