Anthony\n\nSpeeches & Writings File\n\nSpeech before Union Agricultural Society, 1858Yates County Fair\nDundee -\n1858 about\nAgricultural Fair.1\nMr. President &\nMen & Women of Yates County\n\nThis, I believe, is your fifth\nannual gathering under the call of\nthe 'Union Agricultural Society.' For\nfive successive years, your have come\ntogether, [from all parts of this county,]\nwith your best productions of agriculture,\nmanufacture, mechanics and art, each\nwilling to make common stock of his\nindividual experience, to insure the most\nspeedy success and advancement of all.\nThus ends one more industrial year, and\nas I contemplate the symmetrical proportions\nof your horses, cows and sheep, - the perfect-2\ntion of your vegetables & fruits, - your butter\n& cheese, - the beauty of your flowers\nand paintings, the question suggests itself\nto my mind, has the man himself grown\nwith each advancing year? - In the\nmarch of civilization, have the farmers\n[of Yates] themselves, yet come to feel that the development\nof the human being, [transcends] in body & soul,\ntranscends in importance, all outward improvements\n& material gains? -\n- The educated farmer now\nraises a cabbage or a calf according to a\nfixed law; - and he feels, as he labors, an\nassurance in the result. - There is no guess\nwork, chance, or speculation here, - and he realizes\njust what he expects. -- How is it, I ask, in3\nthe improvement & culture of his children?\nDoes he, therein, experience the same satisfactory\nand sure results? - To the contrary,\nFathers & Mothers [of Yates], are not your grown\nup sons & daughters, but too often, the very\nantipodes of your fondest hopes - signal\nfailures - perpetual reminders of your\n[ignorance] violation of the immutable laws of life? -\nThrough generations of ignorance, we are just\nbeginning, in our day, to query with each\nother, if there be not an exact science, by\nwhich man may redeem himself from\nthe discord & suffering that have thus far\nblighted the human race?\n[The Cultivation of the earth]\n[is not only one of the most necessary]", "similar": {"daybook": [[0.8638092685543342, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00683_00886", "201_1"]], [0.8427068724061069, ["daybooks",

The mind needs feeding\ntoo, and your dissatisfactions are but\nthe heaven born complainings\nof the crushed & blighted soul;\nDivine Messengers, that speak\nof progress, that point to better\ndays to come, when [the passing] generation after\ngeneration shall be governed by\nthe true science of life.\nThe strongest proofs we have\nof immortality, are these ceaseless\nstretchings after something higher.\nBut live not wholly in the\nfuture. Begin now to crowd\ninto each passing hour, its rightful\n\nsum of profit and of pleasure, and\ngive not all your lives to gain.\nRemember, what you are, goes with\nyou into eternity; What you\nhoard up, belongs to time alone.\nYes! '[Oh!] press on!\nFor the high ones and powerful shall come\nTo do you reverence; and the beautiful\nWill know the purer language of your soul,\nAnd read it like a talisman of love.\nPress on! for it is god-like to unloose\nThe spirit, and forget yourself in thought\nBending a pinnion for the deeper sky,\nAnd, in the very fetters of your flesh,\nMating with the pure essences of heaven.'", "similar": {"daybook": [[0.8323811567752271, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-003_00768_00999", "221_2"]], [0.8322471514687386, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-004_00461_00683", "195_2"]], [0.8257097021806085, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-003_00768_00999", "221_1"]], [0.8237349649664651, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-003_00551_00767", "106_2"]], [0.8185958733180811, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00349_00517", "5_1"]], [0.8179458070086061, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00683_00886", "51_1"]], [0.8175767001876497, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-002_00764_01001", "118_1"]], [0.816803883115734, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00683_00886", "125_2"]], [0.816670630560018, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-004_00461_00683", "146_2"]], [0.8160815193140234, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00683_00886", "131_1"]], [0.8151379245125366, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-002_00764_01001", "117_1"]], [0.813895826739462, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-004_01051_01246", "37_1"]], [0.8136446246013778, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-004_01051_01246", "111_1"]], [0.8135237500093622, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00519_00682", "142_1"]], [0.8124023250023111, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-002_00764_01001", "98_1"]], [0.8122071357605949, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-004_00008_00230", "87_1"]], [0.8121082836517053, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-002_00107_00307", "166_1"]], [0.8118294237481491, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00349_00517", "102_2"]], [0.8118075082751478, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-002_00409_00631", "161_2"]], [0.8115566336282187, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-003_00768_00999", "163_2"]]], "writings": [[0.902941884523216, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00114_00160", "43_44_45"]], [0.877865126230982, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00059_00113", "51_52_53"]], [0.8739897065050837, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00114_00160", "6_7_8"]], [0.8720596433104466, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00114_00160", "39_40_41_42"]], [0.8684358279957645, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00059_00113", "54_55"]], [0.8648218115028367, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00059_00113", "24_25_26"]], [0.8623703692448723, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00114_00160", "32_33_34_35"]], [0.8618746713102838, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00007_00058", "16_17_18"]], [0.8614138985613442, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00059_00113", "21_22_23"]], [0.8563392987332266, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00007_00058", "51_52"]], [0.8560824767470947, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00007_00058", "40_41_42_43_44"]], [0.8487435698823104, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-006_00609_00651", "27_28_29"]], [0.8468569797594229, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00242_00289", "7_8_9"]], [0.8468274597664344, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00114_00160", "1_2_3_4_5"]], [0.8459869625787978, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00059_00113", "9_10_11"]], [0.8450747003738486, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00059_00113", "15_16_17"]], [0.8434017439795369, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-006_00609_00651", "30_31_32_33"]], [0.8401523410113523, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00114_00160", "13_14_15_16"]], [0.8401081184659196, ["writings", "mss11049.mss11049-007_00242_00289", "12_13"]]], "correspondence": [[0.8232405064733221, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "224_225_226_227"]], [0.8129519764458459, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "155_156"]], [0.7975712788342979, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "15_16_17_18_19_20"]], [0.7964010329691082, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "221"]], [0.7961842137494841, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "173_174"]], [0.7935928134232229, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "54_55_56_57_58"]], [0.792495201460847, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "36_37_38_39_40"]], [0.7919523372277062, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "46_47_48"]], [0.7918421271253385, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "114_115_116_117_118"]], [0.7910477008300847, ["correspondence", "mss11049.mss11049-001_00011_00237", "89_90"]]]}, "digital_id": "mss11049.mss11049-007_00114_00160", "pages": "46_47"}], "date": "1858", "title": "Susan B.
