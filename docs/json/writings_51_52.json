those times\nbelieved it to be the only true\nprinciple, still they refrained\nfrom preaching what to them\nwas truth, because they thought\nthe world not ready [to abandon]\n[the use of fermented liquors.]\nThey continued to preach\nAbstinence from distilled liquors\nonly, lest the utterance of the new truth which\nhad opened to their minds, should8\nhave the effect to repel those\nfrom their ranks who had been\ninduced to [abandon distilled] sign the original\n[liquors] Pledge -- Thus for long years\nwas the doctrine of Abstinence\nfrom distilled liquors only sounded\nin the ears of the

had, indeed,\nwrought a great & glorious good.\nStill the Rumseller, Distiller &\nBrewer pursued their work of\ndeath, under the protection of the\nstrong arm of the Law. -- Still\nthe youth of our land were\never & anon precipitated into\nthe vortex of Drunkenness -\n\n9\n-- their manhood & womanhood,\nwere now clothed in their right\nminds & made to live again.\nThe speculative moralist,\nDivine, accustomed to look\non this degradation, & to them\nhopeless ruin of souls, were now\nstartled, & heard to exclaim,\nCan these dry bones live again?\nAnd, ere the world had\nfully taken in the grand idea of\nthe possibility of the drunkards reform --\nTotal Abstinence, God breathed\ninto some soul an advance\nthought, -- the thought of putting\nan end to the accursed Liquor\nTraffic itself. -- Over 400.000 of\nthat noble army of reformed\nmen & women were again\nfallen victims to the spoiler, x &", "similar": {"daybook": [[0.8407186157168449, ["daybooks",
