During the years I [two & a half years of my paper]\npublished The Revolution, I had the entree of their house\nand home & Each in turn contributed her\npoems to [The Revolution] my paper. 'The Born Thrall',\nrunning through the first half of the year 1870, Alice considered\nthe best of her prose writings. I shall\nnever forget the December Sunday morning\nwhen a note came from Phoebe, saying, 'Miss [Mrs]\nAnthony' will you come round & sit with\nsister, while I go to Church?' - Of course I was\nbut too glad to go; And it was there, in that cheery\nsick-room, as I sat on a low cushion at the feet of\nthat lovely, large souled, clear brained woman,21\n[It was] that she told me, [that] how, ever & anon,\nin the years gone by, as she was writing her\nstories for bread & shelter, her pen would run\noff into facts & philosophies of woman's servitude,\nthat she knew would ruin her book with\nthe publishers, but which, for her own satisfaction,\nshe had carefully treasured, chapter by chapter,\nas her soul had thus overflowed. 'I am now,'\nsaid she, 'financially free - where I can write my\ndeepest and best though for woman. Oh,\nhow much of my life I have been compelled\nto write what men would buy, not what\nmy heart most longed to say, and what a\nclog to my spirit it has been.' As she\nsat there, reading to me from these first\nchapters, her sweet face, her lustrous eyes,\n\n22\n\nher musical voice, all a-glow-as with\na live coal from off the altar, I said,\n'Alice, I must have that story for The\nRevolution!' - 'But I may never be able\nto finish it.' - 'We'll trust to providence for\nthat,' said I, and the first six months of 'The\nRevolution,' of [January] the year 1870 - carried 'The Born\nThrall' to thousands of responsive hearts. But,\nalas, nature gave way, and she was never [able] well enough to\ngive the finishing touches to those terribly true\nto life pictures of the pioneer wife & mother.\n[And] I can but marvel that Mary Clemmer, in\nher attempt to set forth the life & works of Alice\nCarey, should never have mentioned 'The Born\nThrall' - the story, that like its author, was cut\noff, just as it reached its meridian height of\npromise. -", "similar": {"daybook": [[0.858509011920018, ["daybooks", "mss11049.mss11049-002_00308_00407", "74_3"]], [0.8517132262078727, ["daybooks",
